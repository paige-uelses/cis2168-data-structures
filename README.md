**#CIS2168 Data Structures (Temple University)**

Java implementations of data structure exercises:

**Array Manipulation**
  - **ZigZag.java** – Traverses a 2D array in zigzag order
  - **Reverser.java** – Reverses arrays using two-pointer technique
  - **Intersect.java** – Finds intersection of two sorted ArrayLists
  - **Squash.java** – Removes consecutive duplicates from arrays
    
**Stacks & Queues**
  - **Leader.java** - Circle elimination game using linked list (simulates leader election)
  - **SunsetViews.java** - Stack-based algorithm to find building indices with unobstructed sunset views in East or West directions, tracking maximum heights encountered
  - **BracketMatcher.java** - Stack-based validator for balanced brackets, parentheses, and braces; reports either first mismatched position or success
  - **SumQueue.java** - Queue sum calculation exercise with loop boundary fix for size-changing iterations
    
**Trees**
  - **BST2.java** - Generic Binary Search Tree implementation with inorder, preorder, postorder, and level-order traversals, plus search functionality using recursive algorithms

**Heaps & PQs**
  - **Heapifier.java** - Converts arrays into max-heap structure using sink operations with 1-based indexing
  - **TopMints.java** - Finds top M integers using MinPQ versus sorting; includes performance benchmarking on large datasets

**Graphs**
  - **Reachability.java** - DFS implementation determining if vertex y is reachable from vertex x in undirected graph
  - **ConnectedComponents.java** - DFS-based algorithm counting connected components in undirected graph
  - **BFS.java** - Breadth-first search computing shortest path distance between vertices using queue-based traversal

**Applications**
  - **Hand.java** - Poker hand evaluator classifying 5-card hands (straight flush to nothing) using frequency maps and rank arrays
